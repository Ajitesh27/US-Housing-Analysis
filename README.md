After analysis, it was found that the factors influencing the residential home price in the United States are:

- Overall Quality of the house
- The year in which it was built
- Year in which remods were added
- Area of Basement
- Area of 1st foor
- Ground living area
- Full bath or not
- Number of rooms
- Presence of Fireplace
- Number of cars that can be parked in garage
- Garage Area

Apart from these factors other factors which influences the prices are:
    
- Growth in the Economy
- Unemployment
- Interest Rates
- Customer Trust
- Mortgage Availability
- Offering
- Disposal of permission for planning
- Opportunity costs for construction companies as other projects have better returns
- New houses are not ideal for staying in
- Building new homes efficiency
- A rise in construction costs would move demand to the left
